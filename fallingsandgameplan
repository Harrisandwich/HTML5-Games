What I want from a falling sand game:

- Element progression 
	- Gaining elements from experimenting (gain steam from fire and water etc...)
- Enviroment creation
	- mixing elements and planting seeds creates new and interesting life
	- elements interact in ways similar to nature (errosion and the like) 
- Building worlds 
	- having a "planet" with gravity that you can grow and shape 
- Proper weather 
	- tempurature effects percipitation and convection currents 
- Civilizations 
	- as you progress, you may have humans living in your enviroment, collecting materials and building a society of sorts 
-
