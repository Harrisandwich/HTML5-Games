Post apocalypse base:
-------------------------
- grid with tiles in small area
- conduct trades with friends 
- collect resources 
- send out scouts 
- build your base 
- local view of base and map of area
- canvas shows base and facilities
- web page itself has things like a log
  and other interfaces
- ON CANVAS
	- base
	- building interface 
	- area map 
	- visual rep of resources?
	- Trade interface
- ON WEBPAGE
	- activity log
	- Base stats 
	- resources 
	- survivor stats/list
- resources
	- food
		- more survivors -food over time
	- water 
		- more survivors -water over time
	- weapons (general)
		- melee and projectile
		- + defence
		- Can send with scouts to ensure survival
	- ammo (general)

- base stats
	- Food
		- keeps survivors alive 
		- more food, more survivors you can have
	- Water 
		- keeps survivors alive 
		- more water, more survivors you can have
	- Defence 
		- how you hold up to raids or attacks 
	- Morale 
		- how productive your base is
		- average of survivor morale
	- Attraction
		- how likely you are to get survivors coming to your base 
	-storage 
		- how much you can store 
		- this is expressed as a max on resources
			- ex: food: 100/200 200 being the max food storage space 
	- behind the scenes

			- when a structure is created it doesn't start with full health 
			- the better the builder, the better the structures and maintenance
			
			
Screens:
	- Survivor list
		- radio button list to select a survivor and assign to task
	- Building list
		- radio button list to select a building to construct
		- leads you to survivor list to pick a builder 
	- Base list
		- radio button list of bases to interact with



Weapons, Buildings, and Survivors
----------------------------------
- Weapons, buildings, and survivors can be discovered and collected a la fallout shelter
- If i include them in the javascript, advanced users will be able to cheat in the browser and access them
- I could include them in the database, then create the object when the item is discovered.
	- for this there would be 3 tables: Weapons, Buildings, Survivors. 
		_ tbl_weapons
			- name
			- image source
			- damage
			- accuracy
		- tbl_buildings
			- name 
			- image source
			- NOTE: two ways do deal with stats
				- have a field for each stat
					- no extra parsing
					- can grab specific stats 
					- allows for sorting 
					- fields 
						- Food Production
						- Water Production 
						- Morale 
						- Food Storage Mod
						- Water Storage Mod 
						- Comfort Item Storage Mod
						- Building Material Storage Mod 
						- Weapon Storage Mod
						- Survivor Storage Mod 
						- Combat Training
						- Farming Training
						- Building Training 
				- have a delimited string (ex 1|2|5|3|7 etc)
					- less to query the database for	
		- tbl_survivors
			- name 
			- image source 
			- Morale
			- Farming
			- Combat 
			- Scouting 
			- Building
- For testing purposes, the Weapons, buildings, and survivors will be stored locally in the alpha	
- need to figure out how to run the php without allowing the user to interfere. If i use AJAX like below
  then the user can insert whichever number they want and acquire any item.
- this needs to be considered before i move onto the database development portion of the project.
	- most users wont hack the system(wont know how or wont care)
	- users are playing with friends in a room with a player limit (self moderating)
		- they wont want to cheat against their friends, or players will not want to play with someone who cheats
- Actually I just realized that there are a number of ways to cheat with the JS console if I'm not careful/if i care enough:
	- Player could change how much building materials they have
	- player could create a custom building, weapon, or survivor and add it to their base
	- player could "bump" up any stat they want in browser. By changing a variable they could give themselves more food in a time of crisis, then give that food to others.
- RECENTLY DISCOVERED!! : If i throw the javascript into a different file then it cant be tampered with. 


Some TeSQL (get it? like test, but SQL. TeSQL):
-----------------------------------------------
- would have to steal some ajax stuff from sushi bai kioshi

	var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
	xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function()
    {
	
		if(xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)
		{
			//get the response text
			=xmlhttp.responseText;
                        
		}
	}

	
	
	//The page get the menu as a whole. 
    //I originally considered getting each category, but realized that would be unnecessary 
	
	xmlhttp.open("GET","getBuilding.php"+buildingNumber);
	xmlhttp.send();







Key DB update points:
-----------------------
- On game load
- on base discovery
- on landmark discovery 
- on trade/player interaction



List scrolling:
-------------------------------

- Array of items shown
- Array of items 

var itemsShown = new Array();
var items = new Array(); 
var maxItemsShown = 5;
var listModifier = 0; 

for(var i = 0 + listModifier; i < maxItemsShown + listModifier; i++) 
//when mod is 0 items are 1,2,3,4,5
//when mod is 1 items are 2,3,4,5,6 etc
itemsShown.push(items[i]);


//on right button push
if(mod > 0)
{
	mod--;
	//refreshing might not be needed
	refreshList();
}

//on left button push
mod++;
refresh();


//putting together a survivor list 
- create survivors and put into survivor pool
- add to survivor list
