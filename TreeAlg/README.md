# Tree Algorithm Road Map

<h3> Current Fixes and To-Dos for the Branching Simulation</h3>

<br/><br/>


<h5>Wish List:</h5>
<ul>
  <li><h5>Cutting branches</h5><p>I want to be able to cut or pinch off branches to shape the tree. Currently my methods for tracking nodes seems to prevent that. I'll need a clean "kill node" method first.</p></li>
  <li><h5>Make it pretty</h5><p>I would like to pretty it up a touch. Maybe some graphics or whatever</p></li>
  <li><h5>Gamify</h5><p>Currently there is no "game" its just a sim. I would like to find a way to make it fun</p></li>
</ul>
